    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Back in 2012 <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/">Avdi Grimm</a> was offering to pair program
for free &ndash; all you had to do was ask. Avdi <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/02/19/taking-a-break-from-pair-programming/">no longer</a>
offers this amazing service but I wanted to at least share about one of our pairing
sessions as I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity.</p>

<h2>Spree Installer Bug</h2>

<p>The first problem we tackled was a small bug in <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree">Spree Commerce</a>.
During installation it would sometimes incorrectly detect a successful imagemagick
installation.  I had already submitted
a <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/1533">pull request</a> but I didn&rsquo;t know
how to go about writing a test for it.</p>

<p>In the end we decided not to write a real test but we did do a quick spike.
Without going into too much detail, the original
pull request runs a shell command then checks the exit code. If it runs without
errors we can assume imagemagick is correctly installed.</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>shell command to check if imagemagick is installed correctly</h1>

<p>%x(identify -version)</p>

<h1>check exit code</h1>

<p>$? => #&lt;Process::Status: pid 16493 exit 0></p>

<h1>better way to check</h1>

<p>$?.success? => true
```</p>

<p>First thing Avdi says is, &ldquo;lets see if we can override the %x command&rdquo;. I just
stared at him blankly on our screenshare. Wut? How? Do we write a method like
<code>def %x(command)</code> or something? I tried, it doesn&rsquo;t work. So what to do?</p>

<p>Another common way to run shell commands from ruby is to use backticks.</p>

<p><code>ruby
`pwd` =&gt; "/Users/daniel/code\n"
</code></p>

<p>Somehow Avdi knew that the <code>%x</code> syntax uses backticks. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Kernel.html#method-i-60">documented</a>
but I was still surprised he knew this. He had a hunch that we could override
backticks and in turn override <code>%x</code> and that&rsquo;s exactly what we did.</p>

<p><code>`` ruby
class Foo
  def</code>(s)</p>

<pre><code>puts 'hello'
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>But after we wrote this bit I was stuck again. How the heck do you call that
method? <code>Foo.new`('some command')</code> ??? That wont work. The answer is to use
<code>instance_eval</code>.</p>

<p><code>`` ruby
o = Foo.new
o.instance_eval {</code>ls` }</p>

<h1>=> &lsquo;hello&rsquo;</h1>

<h1>with the %x syntax</h1>

<p>o.instance_eval { %x[ls] }</p>

<h1>exit code ok?</h1>

<p>$?  # => 0
```</p>

<p>The other issue was figuring out whether or not we could override the <code>$?</code>
value. But turns out it&rsquo;s read only.</p>

<p>This was the point when Avdi realized that there&rsquo;s no reason
to use backticks or the <code>%x[]</code> way of making system calls because these
versions are mainly used for their return values. All we want to know is if the
command executed successfully and relying on
<code>$?</code> for that info is in a way reaching outside of our methods boundaries.</p>

<p>A simpler/better approach is to call the command and see if
it was successful or not. That&rsquo;s it. And we can do just that with <code>system</code>. Thus our
code refactored to this:</p>

<p><code>ruby
success = system('identify -version')
</code></p>

<p>We replaced 7 lines of code with just that one call in a new
<a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/1660/files">pull request</a></p>

<h2>Double Error Messages</h2>

<p>Then we talked about the double error messages that show up when you have a form &lsquo;hint&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s the same as the error message. I was asking Avdi to help me figure out
how to &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; change the way rails handles this. But it turns out the
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; solution is to not touch rails at all. Instead, change the markup.
This was solved by adding a css style to hide the hint when an error
group is present. That&rsquo;s it! simple!</p>

<h2>Finding Solutions</h2>

<p>This was a valuable lesson I learned from Avdi. While he has the technical chops
to program his way around things that&rsquo;s not what he turns to first.
Instead, he looks to see if the solution being implemented is the right fit.
Often times it&rsquo;s not and there might be a simpler solution to the problem. We just
saw two examples of that.</p>

<h2>Getting Better</h2>

<p>For the last part of our session I asked for advice on improving as a developer.
These are the tips he gave in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pair program</li>
<li>Read code. rack is a good codebase to look at</li>
<li>Read books. Blogs are ok but books tend to have less errors

<ul>
<li>Eloquent Ruby, Ruby Best Practices, The Ruby Way, Ruby Quiz,
ruby talk mailing list, anything written by James Gray,
Peepcode Play by Play</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Thanks Avdi for the awesome pairing session!</h2>

    <link href="http://daniely.github.io/blog/2012/06/08/ping-range-of-urls/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-08T22:45:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://daniely.github.io/blog/2012/06/08/ping-range-of-urls</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Coming from a Microsoft web dev background I&rsquo;m often surprised at how simple yet
productive ruby can be. An example of this is a short (1 line) ruby script I wrote to ping a list of urls and
display summary results.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, switching from the Microsoft stack to the rails stack was hard. But one
thing that helped me feel productive early on was focusing on ruby first.
Not only is ruby essential to becoming a good rails dev but the little wins you have
with it along the way will boost your morale as you struggle through learning
how all the various pieces work together.</p>

<p>A few months back I wanted to find out which VPN server had the best ping.
Since ruby/rails forces (encourages?) you to get familiar with the command line I already
knew there were commands at my disposal that I just needed to leverage.</p>

<h2>The Program</h2>

<p>The basic command I wanted to run was <code>ping vpn.test.com</code>. In ruby, there are
several ways to get a string to run as if it were a command
typed into your terminal shell. The simplest is probably backticks. So if you
put <code>`pwd`</code> in a ruby script it will output something along the lines of
<code>/Users/Daniel/src</code>.</p>

<p>So to run ping all you need to do is <code>`ping vpn.test.com`</code>.
But I didn&rsquo;t want to run the command on just one url, I wanted it on a range.</p>

<p>```
ping vpn-1.test.com
ping vpn-2.test.com
ping vpn-3.test.com</p>

<p>etc&hellip; about 20 urls like this
```</p>

<p>Using ruby we can generate the list of commands (string literals) like so:</p>

<p>```ruby
commands = []   # array of commands
(1..20).each do |num|
  commands &lt;&lt; &ldquo;ping vpn-#{num}.test.com&rdquo;
end</p>

<h1>commands</h1>

<p>[&ldquo;ping vpn-1.test.com&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ping vpn-2.test.com&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ping vpn-3.test.com&rdquo;, etc&hellip; ]
```</p>

<p>Now we have a small problem, the command we want to run is no longer a string
literal. But it&rsquo;s easy enough to get around that by wrapping the command with
<code>#{}</code></p>

<p>We also want to loop through and run each command. Here&rsquo;s how to do both:</p>

<p><code>ruby
commands.each do |command|
  `#{command}`
end
</code></p>

<p>By default the <code>ping</code> command will continue pinging a url until a user cancels the command.
In order to ping one url and then move onto the next without any user intervention
we need to specify a set number of times to ping a url. For that just add the <code>-c</code> flag
along with number of times to ping. In your terminal, running <code>ping -c2 vpn-1.test.com</code>
will result in output like this:</p>

<p>```
PING www.vpn-1.test.com (74.125.131.99): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 74.125.131.99: icmp_seq=0 ttl=46 time=409.803 ms
64 bytes from 74.125.131.99: icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=407.988 ms</p>

<p>&mdash;&ndash; www.vpn-1.test.com ping statistics &mdash;&ndash;
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 407.988/408.895/409.803/0.908 ms
```</p>

<p>Notice that the url was pinged twice because of <code>-c2</code>. To capture this output in ruby just assign
it to a variable.</p>

<p><code>ruby
output = `ping -c2 vpn-1.test.com`
</code></p>

<p>All I&rsquo;m really interested in though is the summary info on the last line. So
let&rsquo;s parse the output. In our <code>ping</code> results, each line ends with a newline <code>\n</code>.
We can ue the <code>split</code> command on a string to split it up into an array. So doing
<code>output.split("\n")</code> will result in an array like:</p>

<p>``` ruby output split into an array</p>

<p>[&ldquo;PING www.l.vpn-1.test.com (74.125.131.99): 56 data bytes&rdquo;,
&ldquo;64 bytes from 74.125.131.99: icmp_seq=0 ttl=46 time=409.803 ms&rdquo;,
&ldquo;64 bytes from 74.125.131.99: icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=407.988 ms&rdquo;,
&ldquo;&rdquo;,
&ldquo;&mdash;&ndash; www.l.vpn-1.test.com ping statistics &mdash;&ndash;&rdquo;,
&ldquo;2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss&rdquo;,
&ldquo;round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 407.988/408.895/409.803/0.908 ms&rdquo;]
```</p>

<p>Then to get the last element in the array call <code>.last</code> on the array. The
full command to parse the output and get the summary info is:</p>

<p><code>ruby parse to find summary info
output_summary = output.split("\n").last
</code></p>

<p>But actually, we don&rsquo;t even need the variable <code>output_summary</code>. We can just parse
on the value returned from the command directly. Like so:</p>

<p><code>ruby
`ping -c2 vpn-1.test.com`.split("\n").last
</code></p>

<p>To output something from your ruby script to the terminal just use <code>puts</code>.</p>

<p>Now putting all the pieces together here is our final script:</p>

<p><code>ruby
(1..20).each do |num|
  command = "ping -c2 vpn-#{num}.test.com"
  puts `#{command}`.split("\n").last
end
</code>
That&rsquo;s it! The first time I saw how little code I had to write I was simply blown away.
To run it, save the script to a file (for example <code>ping_urls.rb</code> then run it with
<code>ruby ping_urls.rb</code>. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like when you run the script.</p>

<p>```
host: vpn-1.test.com round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 354.237/355.450/356.662/1.213 ms
host: vpn-2.test.com round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 348.192/348.192/348.192/0.000 ms
host: vpn-3.test.com round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 345.407/350.691/355.975/5.284 ms
host: vpn-4.test.com round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 343.635/344.315/344.995/0.680 ms
host: vpn-5.test.com round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 352.627/353.346/354.064/0.718 ms</p>

<p>etc&hellip;
```</p>

<p>Just to show you how terse ruby can be you can write the whole thing in one
line without even creating a file to run it from. If you have ruby installed
you can run a command with the <code>-e</code> flag. So typing <code>ruby -e 'puts "hi"'</code> in your
terminal shell will output <code>"hi"</code>. The terse version of the ping script is:</p>

<p><code>ruby terse version run directly from terminal
ruby -e '(1..20)each { |num| `ping -c2 vpn-#{num}.test.com`.split("\n").last }'
</code></p>

<p>Simple yet powerful, no?</p>

    <link href="http://daniely.github.io/blog/2012/05/03/vagrant-nfs-mount-failing-on-mac-osx/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-03T23:01:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://daniely.github.io/blog/2012/05/03/vagrant-nfs-mount-failing-on-mac-osx</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Vagrant is running slow so you decide to try nfs shared folders since there is
a <a href="http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/nfs.html">documented</a> performance boost
with it. However, running <code>vagrant up</code> fails with the error:</p>

<p><code>
Mounting NFS shared folders failed. This is most often caused by the NFS
client software not being installed on the guest machine. Please verify
that the NFS client software is properly installed, and consult any resources
specific to the linux distro you're using for more information on how to
do this.
</code></p>

<p>But I already had nfs on the host and guest machine. The only other clue I
had was a strange message during the modification of /etc/exports:</p>

<p><code>
[default] Exporting NFS shared folders...
[vagrant] Preparing to edit /etc/exports. Administrator privileges will be required...
Password:
su: Sorry
su: Sorry
su: Sorry
</code></p>

<p>Notice the <code>su: Sorry</code> showing up several times.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Turns out that even though I gave the right password, my host machine didn&rsquo;t
have root user enabled. For whatever reason, this was preventing vagrant from
modifying the guest machine&rsquo;s /etc/exports file (shown by <code>su: Sorry</code>). Once I
enabled the root user everything worked just fine.</p>
